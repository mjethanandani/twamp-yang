Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                June 2016


1.  Introduction

   The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] is used to
   measure network performance parameters such as latency, bandwidth,
   and packet loss by sending probe packets and measuring their
   experience in the network.  To date, TWAMP implementations do not
   come with a standard management framework and, as such, configuration
   depends on the various proprietary mechanisms developed by the
   corresponding TWAMP vendor.  This document addresses this gap by
   formally specifying the TWAMP data model using YANG.

1.1.  Motivation

   In current TWAMP deployments the lack of a standardized data model
   limits the flexibility to dynamically instantiate TWAMP-based
   measurements across equipment from different vendors.  In large,
   virtualized, and dynamically instantiated infrastructures where
   network functions are placed according to orchestration algorithms as
   discussed in [I-D.unify-nfvrg-challenges][I-D.unify-nfvrg-devops],
   proprietary mechanisms for managing TWAMP measurements pose severe
   limitations with respect to programmability.

   Two major trends call for revisiting the standardization on TWAMP
   management aspects.  First, we expect that in the coming years large-
   scale and multi-vendor TWAMP deployments will become the norm.  From
   an operations perspective, dealing with several vendor-specific TWAMP
   configuration mechanisms is simply unsustainable in this context.
   Second, the increasingly software-defined and virtualized nature of
   network infrastructures, based on dynamic service chains [NSC] and
   programmable control and management planes [RFC7426] requires a well-
   defined data model for TWAMP implementations.  This document defines
   such a TWAMP data model and specifies it formally using the YANG data
   modeling language [RFC6020].

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Document Organization

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   presents the scope and applicability of this document.  Section 3
   provides a high-level overview of the TWAMP data model.  Section 4
   details the configuration parameters of the data model and Section 5
   specifies in YANG the TWAMP data model.  Section 6 lists illustrative

   examples which conform to the YANG data model specified in this
   document.  Appendix A elaborates these examples further.

2.  Scope, Model, and Applicability

   The purpose of this document is the specification of a vendor-
   independent data model for TWAMP implementations.

   Figure 1 illustrates a redrawn version of the TWAMP logical model
   found in Section 1.2 of [RFC5357].  The figure is annotated with
   pointers to the UML diagrams provided in this document and associated
   with the data model of the four logical entities in a TWAMP
   deployment, namely the TWAMP Control-Client, Server, Session-Sender
   and Session-Reflector.  As per [RFC5357], unlabeled links in Figure 1
   are unspecified and may be proprietary protocols.

   +----------------+                          +--------+
   | Control-Client |  <-- TWAMP-Control -->   | Server |
   +----------------+                          +--------+
           ^                                        ^
           |                                        |
           V                                        V
   +----------------+                     +-------------------+
   | Session-Sender |  <-- TWAMP-Test --> | Session-Reflector |
   +----------------+                     +-------------------+
       [Fig. 5]                                 [Fig. 6]

                  Figure 1: Annotated TWAMP logical model

   As per [RFC5357], a TWAMP implementation may follow a simplified
   logical model, in which the same node acts both as the Control-Client
   and Session-Sender, while another node acts at the same time as the
   TWAMP Server and Session-Reflector.  Figure 2 illustrates this
   simplified logical model and indicates the interaction between the
   TWAMP configuration client and server using, for instance, NETCONF
   [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf].  The data model
   defined in this document is orthogonal to the specific protocol used
   between the Config client and Config server to communicate the TWAMP
   configuration parameters.

   the scope of this document.

3.  Data Model Overview

   A TWAMP data model includes four categories of configuration items.
   Global configuration items relate to parameters that are set on a per
   device level.  For example, the administrative status of the device
   with respect to whether it allows TWAMP sessions and, if so, in what
   capacity (e.g.  Control-Client, Server or both), are typical
   instances of global configuration items.  A second category includes
   attributes that can be configured on a per control connection basis,
   such as the Server IP address.  A third category includes attributes
   related to per test session attributes, for instance setting
   different values in the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
   field.  Finally, the data model could include attributes that relate
   to the operational state of the TWAMP implementation.

   As we describe the TWAMP data model in the remaining sections of this
   document, readers should keep in mind the functional entity grouping
   illustrated in Figure 1.

3.1.  Control-Client

   A TWAMP Control-Client has an administrative status field set at the
   device level that indicates whether the node is enabled to function
   as such.

   Each TWAMP Control-Client is associated with zero or more TWAMP
   control connections.  The main configuration parameters of each
   control connection are:

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                June 2016


   o  A name which can be used to uniquely identify at the Control-
      Client a particular control connection.  This name is necessary
      for programmability reasons because at the time of creation of a
      TWAMP control connection not all IP and TCP port number
      information needed to uniquely identify the connection is
      available.

   o  The IP address of the interface the Control-Client will use for
      connections

   o  The IP address of the remote Server

   o  Authentication and Encryption attributes such as KeyID, Token and
      the Client Initialization Vector (Client-IV) [RFC4656].

   Each TWAMP control connection, in turn, is associated with zero or
   more test sessions.  For each test session we note the following
   configuration items:

   o  The test session name that uniquely identifies a particular test
      session at the Control-Client and Session-Sender.  Similarly to
      the control connections above, this unique test session name is
      needed because at the time of creation of a test session, for
      example, the source UDP port number is not known to uniquely
      identify the test session.

   o  The IP address and UDP port number of the Session-Sender of the
      path under test by TWAMP

   o  The IP address and UDP port number of the Session-Reflector of
      said path

   o  Information pertaining to the test packet stream, such as the test
      starting time or whether the test should be repeated.

3.2.  Server

   Each TWAMP Server has an administrative status field set at the
   device level to indicate whether the node is enabled to function as a
   TWAMP Server.

   Each TWAMP Server is associated with zero or more control
   connections.  Each control connection is uniquely identified by the
   4-tuple {Control-Client IP address, Control-Client TCP port number,
   Server IP address, Server TCP port}. Control connection configuration
   items on a TWAMP Server are read-only.

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                June 2016


3.3.  Session-Sender

   There is one TWAMP Session-Sender instance for each test session that
   is initiated from the sending device.  Primary configuration fields
   include:

   o  The test session name that MUST be identical with the
      corresponding test session name on the TWAMP Control-Client
      (Section 3.1)

   o  The control connection name, which along with the test session
      name uniquely identify the TWAMP Session-Sender instance

   o  Information pertaining to the test packet stream, such as, for
      example, the number of test packets and the packet distribution to
      be employed.

3.4.  Session-Reflector

   Each TWAMP Session-Reflector is associated with zero or more test
   sessions.  For each test session, the REFWAIT parameter (Section 4.2
   of [RFC5357] can be configured.  Read-only access to other data model
   parameters, such as the Sender IP address is foreseen.  Each test
   session can be uniquely identified by the 4-tuple mentioned in
   Section 3.2.

4.  Data Model Parameters

   This section defines the TWAMP data model using UML and describes all
   associated parameters.

4.1.  Control-Client

   The twamp-client container (see Figure 3) holds items that are
   related to the configuration of the TWAMP Control-Client logical
   entity.  These are divided up into items that are associated with the
   configuration of the Control-Client as a whole (e.g. client-admin-
   state) and items that are associated with individual control
   connections initiated by the Control-Client entity (twamp-client-
   ctrl-connection).

   The twamp-client container includes an administrative parameter
   (client-admin-state) that controls whether the device is allowed to
   initiate TWAMP control sessions.

   The twamp-client container holds a list (mode-preference-chain) which
   specifies the preferred Mode values according to their preferred
   order of use, including the authentication and encryption Modes.
   Specifically, mode-preference-chain lists each priority (expressed as
   a 16-bit unsigned integer, where zero is the highest priority and

   mode (expressed as a 32-bit Hexadecimal value).  Depending on the
   Modes available in the Server Greeting, the Control-Client MUST
   choose the highest priority Mode from the configured mode-preference-
   chain list.  Note that the list of preferred Modes may set bit
   position combinations when necessary, such as when referring to the
   extended TWAMP features in [RFC5618], [RFC5938], and [RFC6038].  If
   the Control-Client cannot determine an acceptable Mode, it MUST
   respond with zero Mode bits set in the Set-up Response message,
   indicating it will not continue with the control connection.

   In addition, the twamp-client container holds a list named key-chain
   which relates KeyIDs with the respective secret keys.  Both the
   Server and the Control-Client use the same mappings from KeyIDs to
   shared secrets (key-id and secret-key in Figure 3, respectively).
   The Server, being prepared to conduct sessions with more than one
   Control-Client, uses KeyIDs to choose the appropriate secret-key; a
   Control-Client would typically have different secret keys for
   different Servers.  The secret-key is the shared secret, an octet
   string of arbitrary length whose interpretation as a text string is
   unspecified.  The key-id and secret-key encoding should follow
   Section 9.4 of [RFC6020].  The derived key length (dkLen in
   [RFC2898]) MUST be 128-bits for the AES Session-key used for
   encryption and a 256-bit HMAC-SHA1 Session-key used for
   authentication (see Section 6.10 of [RFC4656]).

   Each twamp-client container also holds a list of twamp-client-ctrl-
   connection, where each item in the list describes a TWAMP control
   connection that will be initiated by this Control-Client.  There
   SHALL be one instance of twamp-client-ctrl-connection per TWAMP-
   Control (TCP) connection that is to be initiated from this device.

   The configuration items for twamp-client-ctrl-connection are:

   ctrl-connection-name
           A unique name used as a key to identify this individual TWAMP
           control connection on the Control-Client device.

   client-ip
           The IP address of the local Control-Client device, to be
           placed in the source IP address field of the IP header in
           TWAMP-Control (TCP) packets belonging to this control
           connection.  If not configured, the device SHALL choose its
           own source IP address.

   server-ip
           The IP address belonging to the remote Server device, which
           the TWAMP-Control connection will be initiated to.  This item
           is mandatory.

   server-tcp-port
           This parameter defines the TCP port number that is to be used
           by this outgoing TWAMP-Control connection.  Typically, this
           is the well-known TWAMP port number (862) as per [RFC5357].
           However, there are known realizations of TWAMP in the field
           that were implemented before this well-known port number was
           allocated.  These early implementations allowed the port
           number to be configured.  This parameter is therefore
           provided for backward compatibility reasons.  The default
           value is 862.

   dscp    The DSCP value to be placed in the TCP header of TWAMP-
           Control packets generated by this Control-Client.  The
           default value is 0.

   key-id
           The key-id value that is selected for this TWAMP-Control
           connection.

   max-count
           If an attacking system sets the maximum value in Count
           (2**32), then the system under attack would stall for a
           significant period of time while it attempts to generate
           keys.  Therefore, TWAMP-compliant systems SHOULD have a
           configuration control to limit the maximum Count value.  The
           default max-count value SHOULD be 32768.

   The following twamp-client-ctrl-connection parameters are read-only:

   client-tcp-port
           The source TCP port number used in the TWAMP-Control packets
           belonging to this control connection.

   server-start-time
           The Start-Time advertized by the Server in the Server-Start
           message ([RFC4656], Section 3.1).  This is a timestamp
           representing the time when the current instantiation of the
           Server started operating.

   ctrl-connection-state
           The TWAMP-Control connection state can be either active or
           idle.

   selected-mode
           The TWAMP Mode that the Control-Client has chosen for this
           control connection as set in the Mode field of the Set-Up-
           Response message ([RFC4656], Section 3.1).

   token   This parameter holds the 64 octets containing the
           concatenation of a 16-octet challenge, a 16-octet AES
           Session-key used for encryption, and a 32-octet HMAC-SHA1
           Session-key used for authentication.  AES Session-key and
           HMAC Session-key are generated randomly by the Control-
           Client.  AES Session-key and HMAC Session-key MUST be
           generated with sufficient entropy not to reduce the security
           of the underlying cipher [RFC4086].  The token itself is
           encrypted using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in
           Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).  Encryption MUST be performed
           using an Initialization Vector (IV) of zero and a key derived
           from the shared secret associated with KeyID.  Challenge is
           the same as transmitted by the Server (Section 4.2) in the
           clear; see also the last paragraph of Section 6 in [RFC4656].

   client-iv
           The Control-Client Initialization Vector (Client-IV) is
           generated randomly by the Control-Client.  Client-IV merely
           needs to be unique (i.e., it MUST never be repeated for
           different sessions using the same secret key; a simple way to
           achieve that without the use of cumbersome state is to
           generate the Client-IV values using a cryptographically
           secure pseudo-random number source.

   Each twamp-client-ctrl-connection holds a list of twamp-session-
   request. twamp-session-request holds information associated with the
   Control-Client for this test session.  This includes information that
   is associated with the Request-TW-Session/Accept-Session message
   exchange (see Section 3.5 of [RFC5357]).  The Control-Client is also
   responsible for scheduling and results collection for TWAMP-Test
   sessions, so twamp-session-request will also hold information related
   to these actions (e.g. pm-index, repeat-interval).

   There SHALL be one instance of twamp-session-request for each TWAMP-
   Test session that is to be negotiated by this TWAMP-Control
   connection via a Request-TW-Session/Accept-Session exchange.

   The configuration items for twamp-session-request are:

   test-session-name
           A unique name for this test session to be used for
           identification of this TWAMP-Test session on the Control-
           Client.

   sender-ip
           The IP address of the Session-Sender device, which is to be
           placed in the source IP address field of the IP header in
           TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets belonging to this test session.

           This value will be used to populate the sender address field
           of the Request-TW-Session message.  If not configured, the
           device SHALL choose its own source IP address.

   sender-udp-port
           The UDP port number that is to be used by the Session-Sender
           for this TWAMP-Test session.  The number is restricted to the
           dynamic port range (49152 .. 65535).  A value of zero
           indicates that the Control-Client SHALL auto-allocate a UDP
           port number for this TWAMP-Test session.  The configured (or
           auto-allocated) value is advertized in the Sender Port field
           of the Request-TW-session message (see also Section 3.5 of
           [RFC5357]).  Note that in the scenario where a device auto-
           allocates a UDP port number for a session, and the repeat
           parameter for that session indicates that it should be
           repeated, the device is free to auto-allocate a different UDP
           port number when it negotiates the next (repeated) iteration
           of this session.

   reflector-ip
           The IP address belonging to the remote Session-Reflector
           device to which the TWAMP-Test session will be initiated.
           This value will be used to populate the receiver address
           field of the Request-TW-Session message.  This item is
           mandatory.

   reflector-udp-port
           This parameter defines the UDP port number that will be used
           by the Session-Reflector for this TWAMP-Test session.  The
           number is restricted to the dynamic port range (49152 ..
           65535) and is to be placed in the Receiver Port field of the
           Request-TW-Session message.  If this value is not set, the
           device SHALL use the same port number as defined in the
           server-tcp-port parameter of this twamp-session-request's
           parent twamp-client-ctrl-connection.

   timeout The length of time (in seconds) that the Session-Reflector
           should continue to respond to packets belonging to this
           TWAMP-Test session after a Stop-Sessions TWAMP-Control
           message has been received ([RFC5357], Section 3.8).  This
           value will be placed in the Timeout field of the Request-TW-
           Session message.  The default value is 2 seconds.

   padding-length
           The number of bytes of padding that will be added to the
           TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets generated by the Session-Sender.
           This value will be placed in the Padding Length field of the
           Request-TW-Session message ([RFC4656], Section 3.5).

   dscp    The DSCP value to be placed in the UDP header of TWAMP-Test
           packets generated by the Session-Sender, and in the UDP
           header of the TWAMP-Test response packets generated by the
           Session-Reflector for this test session.  This value will be
           placed in the Type-P Descriptor field of the Request-TW-
           Session message ([RFC5357]).

   start-time
           Time when the session is to be started (but not before the
           TWAMP Start-Sessions command is issued; see [RFC5357],
           Section 3.4).  The start-time value is placed in the Start
           Time field of the Request-TW-Session message.  The default
           value of 0 indicates that the session will be started as soon
           as the Start-Sessions message is received.

   repeat
           This value determines if the TWAMP-Test session must be
           repeated.  When a test session has completed, the repeat
           parameter is checked.  The value of 0 indicates that the
           session MUST NOT be repeated.  If the value is 1 through
           4,294,967,294 then the test session SHALL be repeated using
           the information in repeat-interval parameter, and the parent
           TWAMP-Control connection for this test session is restarted
           to negotiate a new instance of this TWAMP-Test session.  The
           implementation MUST decrement the value of repeat after
           determining a repeated session is expected.  The value of
           4,294,967,295 indicates that the test session SHALL be
           repeated *forever* using the information in repeat-interval
           parameter, and SHALL NOT decrement the value.  The default
           value of repeat is 0, indicating that once the session has
           completed, it will not be renegotiated and restarted.

   repeat-interval
           This parameter determines the timing of repeated test
           sessions when repeat > 0.  When the value of repeat-interval
           is 0, the negotiation of a new test session SHALL begin
           immediately after the previous test session completes.
           Otherwise, the Control-Client will wait for the number of
           minutes specified in the repeat-interval parameter before
           negotiating the new instance of this TWAMP-Test session.  The
           default value of repeat-interval is 0, indicating immediate
           re-start.

   pm-reg-list
           A list of one or more Performance Metric Registry Index
           values (see [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry], which
           communicate packet stream characteristics along with one or
           more metrics to be measured.  All members of the pm-reg-list

           MUST have the same stream characteristics, such that they
           combine to specify all metrics that shall be measured on a
           single stream.

   pm-index
           One or more Numerical index values of a Registered Metric in
           the Performance Metric Registry
           [I-D.ietf-ippm-metric-registry] comprise the pm-reg-list.
           Output statistics are specified in the corresponding Registry
           entry.

   The following twamp-session-request parameters are read-only:

   test-session-state
           The TWAMP-Test session state can be either accepted or
           indicate the respective error code; see Section 3.5 of
           [RFC5357].

   sid     The SID allocated by the Server for this TWAMP-Test session,
           and communicated back to the Control-Client in the SID field
           of the Accept-Session message; see Section 4.3 of [RFC6038].

                 Figure 4: TWAMP Server UML class diagram

   A device operating in the Server role cannot configure attributes on
   a per TWAMP-Control connection basis, as it has no foreknowledge of
   what incoming TWAMP-Control connections it will receive.  As such,
   any parameter that the Server might want to apply to an incoming
   control connection must be configured at the overall Server level,
   and will then be applied to all incoming TWAMP-Control connections.

   Each twamp-server container holds a list named key-chain which
   relates KeyIDs with the respective secret keys.  As mentioned in
   Section 4.1, both the Server and the Control-Client use the same
   mappings from KeyIDs to shared secrets.  The Server, being prepared
   to conduct sessions with more than one Control-Client, uses KeyIDs to
   choose the appropriate secret-key; a Control-Client would typically
   have different secret keys for different Servers. key-id tells the
   Server which shared-secret the Control-Client wishes to use for
   authentication or encryption.

   Each incoming control connection that is active on the Server will be
   represented by an instance of a twamp-server-ctrl-connection object.
   All items in the twamp-server-ctrl-connection object are read-only,
   as we explain later in this section.

   The twamp-server container items are as follows:

   server-admin-state
           This administrative parameter controls whether the device is
           allowed to operate as a TWAMP Server.  As defined in
           [RFC5357] the roles of Server and Session-Reflector can be
           played by the same host; recall Figure 2.  For a host
           operating in this manner, this parameter controls whether the
           device is allowed to respond to TWAMP control sessions.

   server-tcp-port
           This parameter defines the well known TCP port number that is
           used by TWAMP-Control.  The Server will listen on this port
           number for incoming TWAMP-Control connections.  Although this
           is defined as a fixed value (862) in [RFC5357], there are
           several realizations of TWAMP in the field that were
           implemented before this well-known port number was allocated.
           These early implementations allowed the port number to be
           configured.  This parameter is therefore provided for
           backward compatibility reasons.  The default value is 862.

   servwait
           TWAMP-Control (TCP) session timeout, in seconds (([RFC5357],
           Section 3.1)).

   dscp    The DSCP value to be placed in the IP header of TWAMP-Control
           (TCP) packets generated by the Server.  Section 3.1 of
           [RFC5357] specifies that the server SHOULD use the DSCP value
           from the Control-Client's TCP SYN.  However, for practical
           purposes TWAMP will typically be implemented using a general
           purpose TCP stack provided by the underlying operating
           system, and such a stack may not provide this information to
           the user.  Consequently, it is not always possible to
           implement the behavior described in [RFC5357] in an OS-
           portable version of TWAMP.  The default behavior if this item
           is not set is to use the DSCP value from the Control-Client's
           TCP SYN, as per Section 3.1 of [RFC5357].

   count   Parameter used in deriving a key from a shared secret as
           described in Section 3.1 of [RFC4656], and are communicated
           to the Control-Client as part of the Server Greeting message.
           count MUST be a power of 2. count MUST be at least 1024.

           count SHOULD be increased as more computing power becomes
           common.

   max-count
           If an attacking system sets the maximum value in count
           (2**32), then the system under attack would stall for a
           significant period of time while it attempts to generate
           keys.  Therefore, TWAMP-compliant systems SHOULD have a
           configuration control to limit the maximum count value.  The
           default max-count value SHOULD be 32768.

   modes
           The bit mask of TWAMP Modes this Server instance is willing
           to support; see IANA TWAMP Modes Registry.  Each bit position
           set represents a mode; see TWAMP-Modes at
           http://www.iana.org/assignments/twamp-parameters/twamp-
           parameters.xhtml.  Note: Modes requiring Authentication or
           Encryption MUST include the related attributes.

   There SHALL be one instance of twamp-server-ctrl-connection per
   incoming TWAMP-Control (TCP) connection that is received and active
   on the Server device.  All items in the twamp-server-ctrl-connection
   are read-only.  Each instance of twamp-server-ctrl-connection uses
   the following 4-tuple as its unique key: client-ip, client-tcp-port,
   server-ip, server-tcp-port.

   The twamp-server-ctrl-connection container items are all read-only:

   client-ip
           The IP address on the remote Control-Client device, which is
           the source IP address used in the TWAMP-Control (TCP) packets
           belonging to this control connection.

   client-tcp-port
           The source TCP port number used in the TWAMP-Control (TCP)
           packets belonging to this control connection.

   server-ip
           The IP address of the local Server device, which is the
           destination IP address used in the TWAMP-Control (TCP)
           packets belonging to this control connection.

   server-tcp-port
           The destination TCP port number used in the TWAMP-Control
           (TCP) packets belonging to this control connection.  This
           will usually be the same value as the server-tcp-port
           configured under twamp-server.  However, in the event that
           the user re-configured twamp-server:server-tcp-port after

           this control connection was initiated, this value will
           indicate the server-tcp-port that is actually in use for this
           control connection.

   server-ctrl-connection-state
           The Server TWAMP-Control connection state can be active or
           SERVWAIT.

   dscp
           The DSCP value used in the IP header of the TWAMP-Control
           (TCP) packets sent by the Server for this control connection.
           This will usually be the same value as is configured in the
           dscp parameter under the twamp-server container.  However, in
           the event that the user re-configures twamp-server:dscp after
           this control connection is already in progress, this read-
           only value will show the actual dscp value in use by this
           TWAMP-Control connection.

   selected-mode
           The Mode that was chosen for this TWAMP-Control connection as
           set in the Mode field of the Set-Up-Response message.

   key-id
           The KeyID value that is in use by this TWAMP-Control
           connection.  The Control-Client selects the key-id for the
           control connection.

   count
           The count value that is in use by this TWAMP-Control
           connection.  This will usually be the same value as is
           configured under twamp-server.  However, in the event that
           the user re-configured twamp-server:count after this control
           connection is already in progress, this read-only value will
           show the actual count that is in use for this TWAMP-Control
           connection.

   max-count
           The max-count value that is in use by this TWAMP-Control
           connection.  This will usually be the same value as is
           configured under twamp-server.  However, in the event that
           the user re-configured twamp-server:max-count after this
           control connection is already in progress, this read-only
           value will show the actual max-count that is in use for this
           control connection.

   salt    A parameter used in deriving a key from a shared secret as
           described in Section 3.1 of [RFC4656].  Salt MUST be
           generated pseudo-randomly (independently of anything else in

           the RFC) and is communicated to the Control-Client as part of
           the Server Greeting message.

   server-iv
           The Server Initialization Vector (IV) is generated randomly
           by the Server.

   challenge
           A random sequence of octets generated by the Server.  As
           described in Section 4.1 challenge is used by the Control-
           Client to prove possession of a shared secret.

4.3.  Session-Sender

   The twamp-session-sender container, illustrated in Figure 5, holds
   items that are related to the configuration of the TWAMP Session-
   Sender logical entity.

   The twamp-session-sender container includes an administrative
   parameter (session-sender-admin-state) that controls whether the
   device is allowed to initiate TWAMP test sessions.

   There is one instance of twamp-sender-test-session for each TWAMP-
   Test session for which packets are being sent.

           entity.

   ctrl-connection-name

Internet-Draft            TWAMP YANG Data Model                June 2016


   fill-mode
           Indicates whether the padding added to the TWAMP-Test (UDP)
           packets will contain pseudo-random numbers, or whether it
           should consist of all zeroes, as per Section 4.2.1 of
           [RFC5357].

   number-of-packets
           The overall number of TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets to be
           transmitted by the Session-Sender for this test session.

   packet-distribution
           Defines whether TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets are to be
           transmitted with a fixed interval between them, or whether a
           Poisson distribution is to be used.

   periodic-interval and periodic-interval-units
           If packet-distribution is set to periodic, these two values
           are used together to determine the period to wait between the
           first bits of TWAMP-Test (UDP) packet transmissions for this
           test session.  periodic-interval-units is one of seconds,
           milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds; see [RFC3432].

   lambda and lambda-units
           If packet-distribution is Poisson, the lambda parameter
           determines the corresponding average rate of packet
           transmission.  lambda-units defines the units of lambda in
           reciprocal seconds; see [RFC3432].

   max-interval
           If packet-distribution is Poisson, then this parameter keeps
           a stream active by setting a maximum time between packet
           transmissions.

   truncation-point-units
           One of seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds.

   The following twamp-sender-test-session parameters are read-only:

   sender-session-state
           This read-only item can be either Active or Idle.

   sent-packets
           The number of TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets belonging to this
           session that have been transmitted by the Session-Sender.

   rcv-packets
           The number of TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets belonging to this
           session that have been received from the Session-Reflector.

           The round trip loss for a test session can be calculated as
           sent-packets - rcv-packets.

   last-sent-seq
           The value in the sequence number field of the last TWAMP-Test
           (UDP) packet transmitted for this test session.  Sequence
           numbers start from zero, so this should always be one less
           than the sent-packets value.

   last-rcv-seq
           The value in the sequence number field of the last TWAMP-Test
           (UDP) packet received for this test session.  In the case of
           packet loss in the Session-Sender to Session-Reflector
           direction, this value minus the last-sent-seq will quantify
           the number of packets that were lost in the Session-Sender to
           Session-Reflector direction.

4.4.  Session-Reflector

   The twamp-session-reflector container, illustrated in Figure 6, holds
   items that are related to the configuration of the TWAMP Session-
   Reflector logical entity.

   A device operating in the Session-Reflector role cannot configure
   attributes on a per-session basis, as it has no foreknowledge of what
   incoming sessions it will receive.  As such, any parameter that the
   Session-Reflector might want to apply to an incoming TWAMP-Test
   session must be configured at the overall Session-Reflector level,
   and will then be applied to all incoming sessions.

   The twamp-session-sender container includes an administrative
   parameter (session-reflector-admin-state) that controls whether the
   device is allowed to respond to incoming TWAMP test sessions.  Each
   incoming TWAMP-Test session that is active on the Session-Reflector
   will be represented by an instance of a twamp-reflector-test-session
   object.  All items in the twamp-reflector-test-session object are
   read-only.

            Figure 6: TWAMP Session-Reflector UML class diagram

   The twamp-session-reflector configuration items are:

   refwait
           The Session-Reflector MAY discontinue any session that has
           been started when no packet associated with that session has
           been received for REFWAIT seconds.  The default value of
           REFWAIT SHALL be 900 seconds, and this waiting time MAY be
           configurable.  This timeout allows a Session-Reflector to
           free up resources in case of failure.

   Instances of twamp-reflector-test-session are indexed by a session
   identifier (sid).  This value is auto-allocated by the Server as test
   session requests are received, and communicated back to the Control-
   Client in the SID field of the Accept-Session message; see
   Section 4.3 of [RFC6038].

   When attempting to retrieve operational data for active test sessions
   from a Session-Reflector device, the user will not know what sessions
   are currently active on that device, or what SIDs have been auto-
   allocated for these test sessions.  If the user has network access to
   the Control-Client device, then it is possible to read the data for
   this session under twamp-client:twamp-client-ctrl-connection:twamp-
   session-request:sid and obtain the SID (see Figure 3).  The user may
   then use this SID value as an index to retrieve an individual twamp-
   session-reflector:twamp-reflector-test-session instance on the
   Session-Reflector device.

   If the user has no network access to the Control-Client device, then
   the only option is to retrieve all twamp-reflector-test-session
   instances from the Session-Reflector device.  This could be
   problematic if a large number of test sessions are currently active
   on that device.

   Each Session-Reflector TWAMP-Test session contains the following
   4-tuple: {parent-connection-client-ip, parent-connection-client-tcp-
   port, parent-connection-server-ip, parent-connection-server-tcp-
   port}. This 4-tuple corresponds to the equivalent 4-tuple {client-ip,
   client-tcp-port, server-ip, server-tcp-port} in the twamp-server-
   ctrl-connection object.  This 4-tuple allows the user to trace back
   from the TWAMP-Test session to the (parent) TWAMP-Control connection
   that negotiated this test session.

   All data under twamp-reflector-test-session is read-only:

   sid     An auto-allocated identifier for this TWAMP-Test session,
           that is unique within the context of this Server/Session-
           Reflector device only.  This value will be communicated to
           the Control-Client that requested the test session in the SID
           field of the Accept-Session message.

   sender-ip
           The IP address on the remote device, which is the source IP
           address used in the TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets belonging to
           this test session.

   sender-udp-port
           The source UDP port used in the TWAMP-Test packets belonging
           to this test session.  The number is restricted to the
           dynamic port range (49152 .. 65535).

   reflector-ip
           The IP address of the local Session-Reflector device, which
           is the destination IP address used in the TWAMP-Test (UDP)
           packets belonging to this test session.

   reflector-udp-port
           The destination UDP port number used in the TWAMP-Test (UDP)
           test packets belonging to this test session.  The number is
           restricted to the dynamic port range (49152 .. 65535).

   parent-connection-client-ip
           The IP address on the Control-Client device, which is the
           source IP address used in the TWAMP-Control (TCP) packets
           belonging to the parent control connection that negotiated
           this test session.

   parent-connection-client-tcp-port
           The source TCP port number used in the TWAMP TCP control
           packets belonging to the parent control connection that
           negotiated this test session.

   parent-connection-server-ip
           The IP address of the Server device, which is the destination
           IP address used in the TWAMP-Control (TCP) packets belonging
           to the parent control connection that negotiated this test
           session.

   parent-connection-server-tcp-port
           The destination TCP port number used in the TWAMP-Control
           (TCP) packets belonging to the parent control connection that
           negotiated this test session.

   dscp    The DSCP value present in the IP header of TWAMP-Test (UDP)
           packets belonging to this test session.

   sent-packets
           The number of TWAMP-Test (UDP) response packets that have
           been sent by the Session-Reflector for this test session.

   rcv-packets
           The number of TWAMP-Test (UDP) packets that have been
           received by the Session-Reflector for this test session.
           Since the Session-Reflector should respond to every test
           packet it receives, the sent-packets and rcv-packets values
           should always be identical.

   last-sent-seq
           The value in the sequence number field of the last TWAMP-Test
           (UDP) response packet transmitted for this test session.

   last-rcv-seq
           The value in the sequence number field of the last TWAMP-Test
           (UDP) packet received for this test session.

5.  Data Model

   This section formally specifies the TWAMP data model using YANG.

5.1.  YANG Tree Diagram

   This section presents a simplified graphical representation of the
   TWAMP data model using a YANG tree diagram.  Readers should keep in
   mind that the limit of 72 characters per line forces us to introduce
   artificial line breaks in some tree diagram nodes.

6.  Data Model Examples

   This section presents a simple but complete example of configuring
   all four entities in Figure 1, based on the YANG module specified in
   Section 5.  The example is illustrative in nature, but aims to be
   self-contained, i.e. were it to be executed in a real TWAMP
   implementation it would lead to a correctly configured test session.
   A more elaborated example, which also includes authentication
   parameters, is provided in Appendix A.

6.1.  Control-Client

   The following configuration example shows a Control-Client with
   client-admin-state enabled.  In a real implementation following
   Figure 2 this would permit the initiation of TWAMP-Control
   connections and TWAMP-Test sessions.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <config xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
      <twamp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp">
         <twamp-client>
            <client-admin-state>true</client-admin-state>
         </twamp-client>
      </twamp>
   </config>

   The following configuration example shows a Control-Client with two
   instances of twamp-client-ctrl-connection, one called "RouterA" and
   another called "RouterB".  Each TWAMP-Control connection is to a
   different Server.  The control connection named "RouterA" has two
   test session requests.  The TWAMP-Control connection named "RouterB"
   has no TWAMP-Test session requests.

         </twamp-client>
      </twamp>
   </config>

6.2.  Server

   This configuration example shows a Server with server-admin-state
   enabled, which permits a device following Figure 2 to respond to
   TWAMP-Control connections and TWAMP-Test sessions.

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this draft is designed to be accessed via
   among other protocols by NETCONF [RFC6241].  Protocols like NETCONF
   use a secure a secure transport layer like SSH that is mandatory to

   implement.  The NETCONF Access Control Module (NACM) [RFC6536]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular users to a pre-
   configured set of NETCONF protocol operations and attributes.

   There are a number of nodes defined in this YANG module which are
   writeable.  These data nodes may be considered sensitive and
   vulnerable to attacks in some network environments.  Ability to write
   into these nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on the devices that support this feature.

   Examples of nodes that are particularly vulnerable include

8.  IANA Considerations

Appendix B.  TWAMP Operational Commands

   This document is targeted at configuration details for TWAMP.
   Operational actions such as how TWAMP sessions are started/stopped,
   how results are retrieved, or stored results are cleared, and so on,
   are not addressed by this configuration model and are out of scope of
   this document.

   TWAMP operational commands could be performed programmatically or
   manually, e.g. using a command-line interface (CLI).  With respect to
   programmability, YANG can be used to define NETCONF Remote Procedure
   Calls (RPC), therefore it would be possible to define RPC operations
   for actions such as starting or stopping control or test sessions or
   groups of sessions; retrieving results; clearing stored results, and
   so on.

   However, [RFC5357] does not attempt to describe such operational
   actions, and it is likely that different TWAMP implementations could
   support different sets of operational commands, with different
   restrictions.  Therefore, this document considers it the
   responsibility of the individual implementation to define its
   corresponding TWAMP operational commands data model.
